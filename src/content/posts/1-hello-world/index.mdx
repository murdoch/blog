I'll mostly be posting about video games, and other equally important stuff.

I'm currently making my way through [Assassins's Creed 3](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-3-remastered) on PlayStation 5.
It's surprisingly enjoyable, given that it rarely appears in any of the Assassin's Creed ranking lists I've seen online.
It's set during the American Revolution, and I had an early wow moment when I realised that Haytham, the game's initial protagonist, is, in fact, a Templar and, therefore, a bad dude. I guess the clue was the Masonic symbol on the back of his cape. Anyway, I'm past all that and totally loving the game.
