I rarely play games twice, but have just completed Elden Ring for the **third** time, achieving platinum status. I am now a man.

Players have one objective, to become Elden Lord.
players must traverse the vast, treacherous open world of _the Lands Between_, so that they might bring order to a realm ravaged by dishonoured demigods.

entices players into a tangled, multi-stage questline that unlocks one of the game's secret endings.

This year's <abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr>, Shadow of the Erdtree, _should_ win Game of the Year, and adds even more depth to an already astonishing story.

I wonder what FromSoftware will do next.
Many would like to see a Bloodborne sequel.
I'd love an Elden Ring _prequel_ where we learn more
about the Gloam-Eyed Queen and her connection to Melina
and the Godskin Apostles.


Ranni the Witch is one of Elden Ring’s most compelling characters, drawing players into an intricate, multi-stage questline that impacts the game’s story and unlocks one of its secret endings. Her narrative is filled with mystery, betrayal, and ancient powers, offering insight into the complex lore of the Lands Between. With her haunting voice, ghostly blue appearance, and the iconic four arms, Ranni’s questline stands as one of the game’s longest and most rewarding undertakings. This guide unpacks the key elements of her story, breaking down the steps to aid players in following Ranni’s journey from start to finish.

Ranni can be found early in the game at Ranni’s Rise, located in the northwest part of Liurnia of the Lakes, in the region known as Caria Manor. After fighting through the spectral defenders and the boss at the end of the manor, players ascend to find Ranni waiting in a towering fortress. When first approached, she introduces herself enigmatically as Renna, a name that hints at her hidden past and complex identity. After speaking with her and agreeing to serve her, Ranni enlists the player’s aid in securing the "Dark Moon"—an artifact linked to the powers she wields.

This initial encounter introduces her loyal retainers: Blaidd the Wolfman, Iji the Blacksmith, and Seluvis, a mysterious and morally ambiguous sorcerer. Each NPC has their own reasons for loyalty to Ranni and will play a key role in her questline, guiding the player on a journey that spans the Lands Between.

The next stage in Ranni’s quest requires the player to access Nokron, the Eternal City, a hidden area that unlocks after defeating Starscourge Radahn, one of the game’s most challenging bosses. Upon his defeat, a star crashes into Limgrave, opening a path into Nokron’s depths. There, the player must navigate the haunting ruins of an ancient civilization, filled with spectral enemies and powerful bosses. Ranni’s questline drives players to locate a special item, the Fingerslayer Blade, a weapon capable of severing the influence of the Greater Will and the Two Fingers, powerful entities that govern the world’s fate.

The discovery of the Fingerslayer Blade reveals Ranni’s true intentions: to challenge the Greater Will and the influence of the Outer Gods, which have long exerted control over the Lands Between. By assisting her, players become complicit in her rebellion against the cosmic forces that dictate destiny.

Once the Fingerslayer Blade is delivered to Ranni, she gifts the player the Carian Inverted Statue, which unlocks new areas in the Carian Study Hall. Ranni then departs to Ainsel River, an underground realm teeming with dangers and ancient secrets. Here, the player must retrieve a miniature doll resembling Ranni, which, when interacted with, speaks in Ranni’s voice. She warns the player of a dangerous entity pursuing her: the Baleful Shadow.

The Baleful Shadow encounter is a pivotal moment, as the shadow is revealed to be an agent of the Two Fingers, intent on stopping Ranni's plans. Defeating this powerful enemy clears the way forward to Nokstella, another sprawling underground city filled with wonders and threats, from where players eventually descend even deeper into the Lake of Rot, a lethal area that tests patience and skill. At the end of the Lake of Rot lies the Cathedral of Manus Celes, where the player finds Ranni’s discarded body.

In the Cathedral of Manus Celes, players can offer Ranni the Dark Moon Ring, a key artifact that signifies their commitment to her cause. This scene is both mysterious and intimate, symbolizing the player’s loyalty and acceptance of Ranni’s radical vision for the world. The ring also hints at a deeper bond between the player and Ranni, who had once vowed never to wed but now entrusts her fate to the player, marking a profound moment in the story.

The Dark Moon Ring unlocks Ranni’s true potential, sealing her pact to defy the Greater Will and forge a path free from the influence of the Outer Gods. Her vision is one of independence, self-determination, and, perhaps, a kind of peace brought on by the cold distance of the moon, an ancient and often feared force in the Lands Between.

Following Ranni’s questline unlocks the Age of Stars ending, a unique outcome where Ranni ascends to godhood, ushering in a new era where the Lands Between are free from the control of the Greater Will. Ranni’s motives, while noble in their rejection of oppression, remain enigmatic, as her desire to separate humanity from divine influence brings both freedom and isolation. Her rule promises autonomy, but her icy demeanor suggests a potential cost.

 and the haunting beauty of its world, as well as the choices and sacrifices that shape the Lands Between.
