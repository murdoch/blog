Rails [7.2.beta1](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v7.2.0.beta1) dropped last night, around the same time as [Ruby 3.3.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/05/30/ruby-3-3-2-released/), so I took the time to upgrade both. Here are my top three features of the forthcoming Rails 7.2 release:

## The Dockerfile now includes jemalloc by default

Anyone dealing with memory bloat in rails app has likely been advised to try installing [jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc):

> jemalloc is a general purpose malloc(3) implementation that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support.

Having this as a default in rails dockerfiles gives me confidence that it's the right way to go.
It's no substitute for tracking down the actual source of memory leaks of course, but I saw a decent drop in my memory use after upgrading.

RAM use went from well over 550 MB, to around 350 MB. That's pretty cool. I know I can do more to get the number down, but this is a good start.

## YJIT is enabled by default

Shopify's [YJIT](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit) was merged to Ruby [a while back](https://shopify.engineering/ruby-yjit-is-production-ready), and is now enabled by default for anyone running Ruby 3.3+ on Rails 7.2.
If it makes ruby apps faster, then I'll take it.

## Brakeman and Rubocop in the Gemfile

New rails 7.2 apps now come with both [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) and [Rubocop](https://github.com/rails/rubocop-rails-omakase) in the Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  # Static analysis for security vulnerabilities [https://brakemanscanner.org/]
  gem "brakeman", require: false

  # Omakase Ruby styling [https://github.com/rails/rubocop-rails-omakase/]
  gem "rubocop-rails-omakase", require: false
end
```

Great. Security analysis and code linting. No more arguing with myself over either of these things.

There are a ton of other exciting improvements with this update, and you can read the release notes [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/7_2_release_notes.html).

Amen.
