I learned about [Fly](Fly) while watching [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) on Youtube.
They have a simple one-click _Signup with Github_ option, which only took a few seconds to complete,
and I didn't have to type anything. No messing. After that, I ran the following commands:

```bash
brew install flyctl
fly launch
fly deploy
```

They detected my Dockerfile, installed the dependencies, provisioned a database, and ran the migrations.
Boom. My site was deployed within 5 minutes of landing on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

What an excellent service! It's easy to sign up, deploy, and scale, which means I can get on with the rest of my day.
