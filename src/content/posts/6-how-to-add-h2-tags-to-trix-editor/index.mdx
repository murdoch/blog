[Trix](https://trix-editor.org/) is a rich text editor from [37signals](https://37signals.com/), aka [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), which is built-in to [ActionText](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html), making it easier to add rich text content to [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) apps.

The toolbar at the top of the editor has a button for adding header tags. By default it spits out H1 tags, but I already add an H1 elsewhere in my markup, and would prefer if the button added an H2 tag instead.

I took a few wrong turns looking for the best way to do this, and in the end it was surprisingly simple. All I needed was the following javascript:

```javascript
Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading1.tagName = "h2"
```

Tada. That was easy.  Now when I hit the heading button, it inserts an H2 tag into my document, rather than an H1.

## Where should I put the javascript?

You _could_ put it in `app/javascript/application.js`, but I actually created a separate file named `admin.js`, which I only load for logged in users. This helps reduce the amount of javascript regular non-admin users have to download when they hit the site.

My `admin.js` file looks like this:

```javascript
import "trix"
import "@rails/actiontext"

Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading1.tagName = "h2"
```

That's about it for now.
