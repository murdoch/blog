[FromSoftware's](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/) collaboration with [George R. R. Martin](https://georgerrmartin.com/) sets a new standard for open-world
games with its atmospheric storytelling and immersive lore.

Players must traverse the vast, mysterious open-world of _the Lands Between_, charged with becoming Elden Lord,
so that they might bring order to a treacherous realm ravaged by dishonored demigods.

The demanding gameplay unveils a deeply-layered, complex narrative reminiscent of Malazan, The Stormlight Archive, and perhaps even Lord of the Rings.

Ranni's questline is the most enjoyable part of the game.
It unlocks an alternate ending, and takes the player to the mesmerising
Eternal City of Nokron, as well as Siofra River, The Lake of Rot and The Moonlight Altar,
all easily missed. The game rewards the explorer.

This year's <abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr>, Shadow of the Erdtree, _should_ win game of the year, and adds even more depth to an already astonishing story.

I rarely play games twice, but have completed Elden Ring **three** times in a row, achieving platinum status on my final playthrough. I am now a man.

I wonder what FromSoftware will do next. Perhaps we'll see a Bloodborne sequel?
Personally I'd love an Elden Ring prequel where we learn more
about the Gloam-Eyed Queen, and her connection to Melina.

I suppose we'll know soon enough.
