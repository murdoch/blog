[Ubisoft](https://www.ubisoft.com/) have announced that the next Assassin's Creed game will be called Shadows, and it will hit the shelves on February 14th, 2025.

So far all we really know is that you will play as a Ninja, and it's set in feudal Japan, a bold move considering the cult following of recent classics like [Sekiro](https://www.sekirothegame.com/), [Ghost of Tsushima](https://www.suckerpunch.com/category/games/ghostoftsushima/) and [Nioh](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/nioh/).

The [promotional webpage](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-3-remastered) gives the following foreword:

> Live the intertwined stories of Naoe, an adept shinobi Assassin from Iga Province, and Yasuke, the powerful African samurai of historical legend. Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this remarkable duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan.

There's been some online backlash over certain perceived historical inaccuracies concerning the game's male protagonist Yasuke, but Japanese gamers are reportedly pre-ordering in droves, so if it's good enough for them then it's probably going to be good enough for me too.

Some say that Assassin's Creed ended when Ezio died, but I'm an eternal fan of the franchise and will be dialing in as soon as it hits midnight on February 14th.
