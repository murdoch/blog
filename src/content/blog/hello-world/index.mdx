I'll mostly be posting about video games, and other equally important stuff.

I'm currently making my way through Assassins's Creed 3 on PlayStation 5. It's surprisingly enjoyable given that it rarely gets a mention in any of the Assassins' Creed ranking lists I've seen online. It's set during the American Revolution, and I had an early wow moment when I realised that Haytham, the game's initial protagonist, is in-fact a Templar, and therefore a bad dude. I guess the clue was the Masonic symbol on the back of his cape. Anyway, I'm past all that, and totally loving the game.
