# Hello World

This is the code for my blog, which can be found at https://murdo.ch

The site is built with astro. Feel free to clone this repo. You can get it running with:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:4321

Write some posts.
You will need to update the site url in `astro.config.mjs`, and `package.json`.
Then you can deploy somewhere like github pages.

Good luck.
